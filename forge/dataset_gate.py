"""dataset_gate.py — one source of truth for "this training file was verified".

`verify_dataset.py` WRITES the receipt; `train_native.py` REQUIRES it. The
hashing rule lives here once, so a receipt cannot come to mean two different
things in two places.

A receipt vouches for FILE CONTENT, never for a filename: each entry carries the
sha256 of the exact bytes that were verified. Rebuild a dataset and its hash
changes, the stale receipt stops covering it, and training refuses to start.
That is the whole point — "every pair is verified before training" is enforced
here by a mechanism instead of by remembering to run a script.

There is deliberately NO bypass flag. A switch that let training proceed on
unverified data would make the claim this module exists to guarantee false again.

WHO MAY ISSUE A RECEIPT, and what this does NOT protect against — stated here
rather than left implicit, because a guard that overstates its reach is worse
than no guard:

  - A receipt is NOT proof of success by its existence. verify_dataset.py writes
    one on every run, recording the violation count truthfully including when it
    fails. `require_verified` is the only thing that grants permission, and it
    demands violations == 0 AND a matching hash. A failed run therefore replaces
    a passing receipt with a failing one, which is the intended behaviour.
  - This is unsigned plain JSON. It defends against DRIFT and ACCIDENT — a
    regenerated dataset, a stale receipt, hand-edited rows, a file swapped after
    verification. It does NOT defend against someone who edits the receipt
    itself, and it is not intended to; that would need signing and a key this
    project has nowhere to keep.
  - It certifies bytes, not judgement. "Verified" here means exactly: every pair
    in this file was executed and `chosen` passed while `rejected` failed. It
    says nothing about whether the pairs are good training signal.
  - A receipt speaks only for the GATE VERSION and the SPLIT it was issued
    under. "0 violations" is the answer verify_dataset.py gave to the questions
    IT asked, checked against the frozen split it read at the time. Change
    either and the answer can differ on the same bytes, so both are in the
    fingerprint below and an outstanding receipt stops applying. That
    invalidation regenerates nothing: what it buys is that the staleness is
    LOUD instead of silent. Re-verifying is the maintainer's explicit decision
    (docs/UBUNTU-BOOTSTRAP.md, step 6).

Stdlib only, on purpose: this is imported both by the system Python (verify side)
and by .venv-train's Python 3.11 (training side).

                    # it differently, and require_verified() catches the new
                    # entries itself with a message naming which one moved. A
                    # bump would refuse the same receipts one check earlier and
                    # say only "wrong schema". Precedent at this same number:
                    # task_bank.py joined the fingerprint inside schema 5 --
                    # data/prereg_track_a_run1.json records the 3-file set and
                    # the committed schema-5 receipt records 4.

# THE RECEIPT MUST PIN THE VERIFIER, NOT ONLY THE DATA.
# "0 violations" is a statement about forge.verify() run against forge.SEED_TASKS.
# Weaken one assert, loosen the BANNED regex, shorten CAND_TIMEOUT, or drop the
# return-type guard, and every data hash still matches while the *meaning* of
# "verified" silently changes — producing a PASSING receipt for a weaker claim.
# That is worse than a failing one.
#
# Whole file, deliberately. The tempting alternative is to hash only "the parts
# that matter" — SEED_TASKS, BANNED, CAND_TIMEOUT, the harness template. That
# requires hand-picking which parts of a verifier are semantic, which is exactly
# the invented-scope mistake this project keeps paying for: the guard passes while
# the thing it guards has moved. A whole-file hash has no scope to get wrong.
# The price is real and accepted: editing a comment in forge.py invalidates the
# receipt and forces a re-verify. That is the correct direction to be wrong in.
#
# ...AND THE VERIFIER INCLUDES THE GATE THAT ISSUES THE RECEIPT. forge.py decides
# whether a candidate passes. verify_dataset.py decides what a VIOLATION IS:
# which lines count as rows, whether a line it cannot parse is skipped or
# counted, whether a file with nothing in it certifies anything, whether a pair's
# task is even allowed on the training side. Those four questions were added to
# it (see its docstring); before them a receipt said "0 violations" without any
# of them having been asked -- and the fingerprint did not move when they
# arrived, because forge.py, the task source and the interpreter were all
# untouched. So the old receipt stayed matching, require_verified() went on
# granting permission, and every one of the four new checks was invisible at the
# moment it mattered. That is the same silent-weakening this block exists to
# stop, one file over, in the file we actually keep changing.
#
# SELF-REFERENTIAL ON PURPOSE, and there is no fixed point to chase:
# verify_dataset.py asks this module for the fingerprint, so the receipt it
# writes records its own bytes. The hash lands in the receipt, never in the file
# being hashed.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER: dataset_gate.py itself. It is the code doing the
# comparing, so whatever bytes are running are the ones deciding and a receipt
# cannot attest to them. A real limit of the mechanism, stated rather than
# papered over.
VERIFIER_FILES = ("forge.py", "verify_dataset.py")

# ...AND THE VERIFIER IS NOT ONLY forge.py EITHER. "0 violations" is a statement
# about verify() run against A SET OF TASKS, so whatever supplies those tasks is
# part of what "verified" means. Until section 91 the task set was SEED_TASKS,
# a literal inside forge.py, and the forge.py hash therefore covered it for free.
# It no longer does: verify_dataset.load_tasks() now also builds tasks from the
# SCREENED payloads, so the definitions live in a data file and the harness that
# binds their entry point lives in screen_tasks.py. Change either and the tests a
# pair is judged against change while every hash in the old fingerprint still
# matches — the exact silent-weakening failure the block above exists to stop.
#
# Whole files again, for the reason given above: hashing "just the payloads we
# used" would mean hand-picking which bytes are semantic, and that is the
# invented-scope mistake this project keeps paying for. The price is the same one
# already accepted — screening a new task invalidates the receipt and forces a
# re-verify. That is the correct direction to be wrong in.
#
# task_bank.py ADDED (codex review fold, repo-hygiene branch): the entry-point
# harness (`as_task`) that used to live entirely inside screen_tasks.py was
# split out so verify_dataset.py's PUBLISHED copy could import it without
# also importing screen_tasks.py's private overnight/STOP-file machinery
# (screen_tasks.py cannot ship: it names the private overnight loop's STOP
# path directly).
# "0 violations" is still a statement that depends on as_task()'s bytes, so
# the file that now actually defines it has to be in this tuple too — leaving
# it out would be exactly the silent-weakening this whole block exists to
# stop, just relocated one file over.
TASK_SOURCE_FILES = ("screen_tasks.py", "task_bank.py", "data/screen_results.jsonl")

# ...AND "VERIFIED" INCLUDES WHICH SPLIT IT WAS CHECKED AGAINST.
# verify_dataset.partition_violations() reads data/ruler_frozen.json at
# verification time and refuses any pair whose task is a frozen RULER task or
# sits outside the training pool. The verdict therefore depends on that file's
# bytes exactly as it depends on forge.py's -- and the receipt recorded no trace
# of it. Re-freeze the ruler so a training-pool task becomes an eval task and the
# old receipt still matched, still said 0 violations, and still granted
# permission to train on a pair drawn from the eval set. The pairs had not
# changed and neither had the verifier; the ANSWER had, and the receipt could not
# say which question it had answered.
#
# IN THE SAME `verifier` MAP rather than a new receipt field, because
# require_verified() already compares that map whole and already names the
# entries that moved: one comparison, one refusal, one place for a maintainer to
# look. A separate field would need its own compare and its own message to say
# the same thing, and two mechanisms for "what did this receipt mean" is exactly
# the drift this module exists to prevent. Precedent for a DATA file in the map:
# data/screen_results.jsonl is already there, for the same reason -- it decides
# what a verdict means.
SPLIT_FILES = ("data/ruler_frozen.json",)

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ...AND THE VERIFIER IS NOT ONLY ITS SOURCE. It is source PLUS the interpreter
# that executes the candidate. The block above says the failure mode exactly:
# "every data hash still matches while the *meaning* of 'verified' silently
# changes". A different Python is precisely that, and section 71 caught it live.
# forge.verify() launched [sys.executable, ...], so ground truth was inherited
# from whichever script called it: screen_tasks.py/build_ruler.py re-exec under
# .venv-train (3.11) via venv_guard, while eval.py/forge.py run under system
# 3.14. Red witness: 310 completions replayed through verify() under both, same
# bytes -- 3.14 scored 172/310, 3.11 scored 154/310, all 18 disagreements one
# way, cause PEP 649 deferred annotations (`def f(x: List[int])` with no import
# is a NameError on 3.11 and harmless on 3.14).
#
# The pin LIVES HERE, in the one module both interpreters already import, so
# there is a single definition rather than one per caller -- the mistake
