"""tests/test_dataset_gate_holes.py — five ways the data gate said PASS.

verify_dataset.py is the mechanism behind "every training pair was executed and
checked". These are the inputs on which it said so without having checked.

  1. SIGNATURE COLLISION. signature() concatenated prompt + chosen + rejected +
     tid with no delimiter and hashed the result. Concatenation is not
     injective: {"prompt": "ab", "chosen": "c"} and {"prompt": "a",
     "chosen": "bc"} build the same string, so two DIFFERENT pairs got the same
     identity. load_pairs() keeps the first and lets every later file inherit
     its verdict, so the second pair was never executed and still counted as
     verified. The fix hashes a canonical JSON object of the four named fields,
     where the field boundaries survive.
  2. A MALFORMED LINE WAS SKIPPED IN SILENCE. `except json.JSONDecodeError:
     continue`. A truncated write, a half-flushed append, a hand-edit -- the
     row vanished from the count, and the gate reported PASS over the rows it
     could still parse. A file the gate cannot read is not a file the gate has
     cleared.
  3. NO PARTITION CHECK. Nothing asserted that a training pair belongs to the
     training side of the frozen split. A pair labelled with one of the 31
     frozen RULER task ids -- the eval set -- would have been executed,
     verified, and passed, because "chosen passes and rejected fails" is true
     of a contaminating pair too. The gate's own subject matter is which pairs
     may be trained on, so this one it has to answer.
  4. A FILE WITH NOTHING IN IT PASSED AFFIRMATIVELY. Every count the gate
     reports is a count OVER the rows it parsed, so a file truncated to zero
     length -- or left holding only blank lines -- came out zero on all of
     them and the report said "PASS: 0/0 pairs valid" with exit 0. The receipt
     entry, {"pairs": 0, "violations": 0}, is the exact shape
     require_verified() grants permission on, so training then started on it.
     A present pair file with no parseable row is now a violation of its own.
  5. A RECEIPT OUTLIVED THE GATE THAT ISSUED IT. Every fix above changed what
     verify_dataset.py checks, and nothing recorded WHICH version of that file
     wrote a receipt: the fingerprint covered forge.py, the task source and the
     interpreter, never the gate's own bytes. So a receipt written by the OLD
     gate -- the one that skipped malformed lines, certified an empty file and
     never looked at the partition -- is byte-indistinguishable from one written
     after, require_verified() honours it, and all four fixes are invisible at
     consumption time. The same silence covered the frozen split: the partition
     check reads data/ruler_frozen.json at verification time, so with the split
     unrecorded a receipt stays valid across a re-freeze that moves a training
     task into the eval set, and training on eval data becomes possible under a
     receipt that is still, on its own terms, correct.

Each test keeps the broken twin beside it (test_stats_core.py idiom) and
asserts the twin STILL misbehaves, so a test that stops discriminating is
itself a failure rather than a silent pass.

THE PIN. Importing verify_dataset pulls in dataset_gate, which SystemExits when
neither .venv-train nor SRLM_VERIFY_PY resolves. Declared here through the
module's own documented override, and only when the operator has not already
chosen -- the same path tests/test_replicate_provenance.py takes, for the same
reason. Nothing here executes a candidate, so the interpreter's identity does
not enter any assertion.

NOTHING HERE TOUCHES data/. main() is never called: tests 1-4 drive load_pairs()
or partition_violations() against fixtures in a temp directory, or read the
committed pairs without verifying them. The class-5 tests do write receipts, but
only into temp directories: each one assembles a receipt from the same two
helpers main() writes with (dataset_gate.build_file_entries and
verifier_fingerprint) and re-points dataset_gate.HERE at a byte-copy of the
fingerprinted files, so "the verifier changed" and "the split moved" can be
staged without editing anything in the repo. data/dataset_verification.json is
never written and data/ is read only to copy it. Receipt regeneration is the
maintainer's explicit decision (docs/UBUNTU-BOOTSTRAP.md, step 6).
