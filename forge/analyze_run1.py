"""analyze_run1.py — the preregistered comparison, and nothing more than it.

Runs exactly the analysis fixed in data/prereg_track_a_run1.json BEFORE the
first replicate was scored: run-level greedy-free pass@1, Welch on each arm's
OWN standard deviation (never pooled), two-sided, alpha 0.05, fixed N = 40 per
arm.

Welch and not Student's t because pooling assumes the two arms have the same
variance, and the whole question is whether training changed the model -- a
change in spread is a change. Pooling would hide it in the denominator.

A paired per-task comparison is reported SECOND, as a secondary view. Both arms
see the identical frozen task set, so pairing removes between-task difficulty,
which is the largest source of variance here. It is secondary because the
preregistration named the run-level test as primary, and promoting whichever
test gives the better answer after seeing both is the exact move preregistration
exists to prevent.

No scipy on this machine, so the t distribution is implemented in stats_core.py
(extracted from this file 2026-08-31, behavior-preserving, output byte-identical;
one implementation, imported by everything that reports a p-value). Checked
against known values in main().

THREE THINGS THIS FILE USED TO GET WRONG, and what it does instead
------------------------------------------------------------------
1. POOLING ACROSS VERIFIERS. Rows were grouped by MODEL alone. The base arm
   'llama3:8b-instruct-q4_K_M' holds 10 rows banked before the verifier was
   pinned (verifier absent entirely, replicate counter 1..10) and 40 banked
   after it (CPython 3.11.9, replicate counter restarted at 1..40). Averaging
   them produced one "base mean" over two different instruments, and the gap it
   hid is 7.6 pp -- larger than every effect this file reports. Every arm is now
   partitioned by provenance.verifier_key(), the same key ruler_noise.py pools
   on; the base arm reports the pinned 40 as the reference and prints the
   pre-pin 10 separately under an explicit NOT-POOLABLE line. Because the
   replicate counter restarts per key, a run-order or drift statistic is only
   meaningful WITHIN one key, and there is deliberately none across keys here.
2. A METRIC LABEL THAT WAS TRUE OF ONLY TWO OF THE THREE ARMS. The header said
   "greedy-free run-level pass@1" over the whole report. It is true of the two
   compared arms, whose rows carry greedy=null and five sampled draws. The base
   arm's rows carry a greedy draw plus four sampled ones, and its banked
   aggregate INCLUDES the greedy draw. Both constructions are now computed for
   every arm and printed side by side, and the label on the banked aggregate is
   derived by comparing it against both -- checked, not asserted. Comparing is
   not enough BY ITSELF, though: the two constructions can come out equal, and
   the label then used to read that tie as proof that no greedy draw existed.
   Presence is a fact about the ROW SHAPE and is now read from the row shape --
   see has_greedy_draw() and stored_construction().
3. AN UNMEASURED TASK SCORED AS ZERO. The per-task view enumerated tasks from
   the trained arm only, so a task present in just the null arm was invisible;
   and a task whose `sampled` list was empty was averaged in as 0.0, which is
   the score of a task that was measured and failed everywhere. Tasks now come
   from the UNION of both arms, an entry with no sampled draws contributes
   nothing, a task with no measurement in either arm is excluded, and the
   excluded count is printed rather than absorbed.
