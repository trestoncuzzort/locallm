"""check_my_computer.py — will this run here, and how fast? Ask the machine.

    python check_my_computer.py          (or double-click "Check My Computer.bat")

Run this once after installing. It checks what you have, times a real training
step on it, and tells you in plain words what you can train and how long it will
take. Everything it says about speed is MEASURED on this computer, not copied
from someone else's.

WHY THIS EXISTS AND WHY IT IS SEPARATE FROM bench_device.py. The studio shows
"about 5 minutes" next to each size, and those numbers come from a benchmark
file. With no benchmark it refuses to guess and says the machine has not been
timed - correct, and useless to someone who just installed it. This produces
that file.

It could not simply BE bench_device.py, for two reasons that only appear at
install time:

  * bench_device.py does `import torch` at the top, so on a machine where torch
    is missing it dies with a traceback instead of saying "torch is missing, here
    is the command". The one moment you most need a clear answer is the moment
    the thing is not installed.
  * bench_device.py times against corpus.txt, and a fresh install has no corpus
    yet. Timing does not depend on WHAT the text says - only on the shapes of
    the tensors - so this builds a small synthetic text and says so.

The timing itself is bench_device.time_steps, imported rather than copied. Two
implementations of "how fast is a step" would drift, and this repo has paid for
a duplicated helper before.
