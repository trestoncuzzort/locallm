"""checkpoint.py — load a model YOU trained back off disk. One implementation.

WHY THIS EXISTS. studio.py could only ever sample a model it had just trained in
the same session: `self.model` was assigned in exactly one place, the "done"
message at the end of a training run, and the Sample button was created
`state="disabled"` and only re-enabled from that same handler. Nothing anywhere
loaded `<out>/ckpt.pt`. So closing the GUI and reopening it left the trained model
on disk unreachable — the button sat greyed out, clicking it did nothing, and
`_generate` began with `if self.model is None: return`, which is silent. From the
outside that is "I trained it and now it won't talk back."

generate.py already knew how to do this, in four lines inside `main()` where no
other caller could reach them. Rather than copy those lines into the GUI — the
mistake `venv_guard.py` exists in the parent repo to end, where a helper copied
into a second file was correct in the first and wrong in the second — the load
lives here once and both callers import it.
