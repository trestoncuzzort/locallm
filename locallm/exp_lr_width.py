"""exp_lr_width.py — experiment 1: is a hardcoded lr=3e-4 wrong for this width?

Two preregistered profiles, and they are DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTS, not two speeds
of one:
  canonical  prereg_lr_width.json       2000 steps, 7-LR grid  (~2.5 min)
  fast       prereg_lr_width_fast.json   800 steps, 4-LR grid  (~1 min)
The effect size decays roughly 9x from 400 to 2000 steps, so the fast profile
reports a LARGER gap for the same phenomenon and licenses only the weaker claim
"reaches lower train loss faster". Each run writes its profile, step count, grid
size and claim into its own verdict string, so the two cannot be quietly
conflated later.

Each profile runs:
  stage 1  sweep LR at fixed width, single seed, to select the treatment arm
  stage 2  control (3e-4) vs treatment, 5 seeds each, train-loss endpoint

Endpoint is TRAIN loss on purpose: a positional train/val split can duplicate
training text into validation, so a val endpoint is not yet trustworthy here.
Eval batches come from a dedicated torch.Generator, never the global RNG, so
every arm sees identical batches and evaluation cannot perturb training.

    python exp_lr_width.py                     # canonical, ~2.5 min
    python exp_lr_width.py --profile fast      # separate experiment, ~1 min
    python exp_lr_width.py --quick             # 400-step sanity pass, not a result

    """The numeric bar, READ FROM THE PREREGISTRATION that declared it.

    This file printed prereg['success_bar']['primary'] and then decided against
    a literal 0.020 in three places. Change the preregistration and the
    experiment goes on answering the old question while printing the new one:
    measured with the bar raised to 0.500 and a stubbed gap of 0.0500, it
    printed "gap >= ... >= 0.500" and then "bar = 0.020" and PASS.

    The bar lives in prose because the prose is what a reader checks the run
    against, so it is parsed out rather than duplicated into a numeric field --
    a second field would be a second place for the two to disagree. If it
    cannot be read, the experiment stops: a confirmatory run that does not know
    its own bar has nothing to confirm.

    PARSING PROSE MEANS REFUSING PROSE IT CANNOT READ. The failure this guards
    is not an exception, it is a WRONG NUMBER THAT RUNS: the previous pattern
    read "gap >= 5e-1" as 5.0 and "gap >= 0.020junk" as 0.020, and either would
    have printed "bar = ..." and a PASS/FAIL verdict against a bar the
    preregistration never set. So the token must be a complete numeric literal
    with nothing of the number left over, and anything else raises.

    ONE bar, too. If the prose carries two different ">= <number>" tokens --
    "n >= 5 seeds and gap >= 0.020" -- the old pattern took the first and read
    the bar as 5.0. There is no rule that makes one of them the right one, so
    this refuses and says which two it found. Repeats of the SAME number are
    fine: they cannot be ambiguous.

    AND EVERY COMPARISON COUNTS, not only the ones that parsed. The refusal
    above was implemented with findall, which returns successes: it could refuse
    "gap >= 0.020junk" alone, because then there was nothing to return, but
    "n >= 5 seeds and gap >= 0.020junk" returned 5.0 -- the bar of the readable
    half, silently standing in for a sentence half of which is unreadable. So
    the ">=" occurrences are enumerated first and each is required to parse as a
    complete comparison; one that does not is named and raises. See _GE.
