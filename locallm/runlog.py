"""runlog.py — an append-only record of every run, so evidence accumulates.

    python runlog.py              # summary of everything recorded
    python runlog.py --kind train # just training runs
    python runlog.py --last 20    # the most recent 20
    python runlog.py --review     # the digest to hand a reviewer

Every training run, experiment, benchmark and leakage scan appends one line to
runs.jsonl. Nothing is ever overwritten or deleted by this module.

Why: result files that get overwritten by the next run cannot show a trend, and
a number quoted from memory is not evidence. Twenty runs recorded with their
configuration, their machine and their timing are reviewable; the same twenty
runs printed to a terminal that has since been closed are not.

What a record deliberately includes:
  - a fingerprint of the CORPUS, so runs on different text are never compared
  - a fingerprint of the SPLIT, because the corpus fingerprint cannot tell two
    runs on different holdouts apart, and every prereg here assumes they match
  - the DEVICE and model configuration, so a slower number is attributable
  - the DATA device where it differs, because a corpus that fell back to host
    memory changes both the ms/step and the batch sequence
  - wall clock and ms/step, so a change in speed is visible
  - the leakage verdict where one applies, so a val loss is never read without
    knowing whether it means anything

    # val_chars, val_frac, seed), which is the content AND the two fields

    # not identify a holdout, because group_split answers different requests

    # sources, the markdown corpus returns the identical 15-character holdout
    # (val_sha1 51c7fa5fba92) for val_frac 0.0002 at seed 4242 and at seed
    # 20260901, and an identical 3-character one at four different seeds. So
    # two runs scored on byte-identical validation text under different seeds
    # counted as two holdouts and printed the warning below, which is false, and
