"""Is the studio actually usable by someone who has never heard of a transformer?

THE REQUIREMENT: as simple as possible for people who are not programmers to
understand and actually use. Preset options rather than places to type, sliders
where a slider fits, and a graph that makes more than mathematical sense to the
person looking at it.

Three of those four are mechanically checkable and are checked here. The fourth
(does the graph make sense) is a judgement, but the thing it rests on -- that the
plotted quantity is a count of characters rather than a log-probability -- is
checkable, so that is what is pinned.

RED WITNESS, against the previous version of studio.py (git 7c7959c):
    FAIL test_nothing_to_type_on_the_main_screen: 13 typing box(es) on the main
