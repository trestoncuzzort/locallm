"""studio.py — build and train your OWN AI from scratch, with no jargon.

    python studio.py          (or double-click "Train My AI.bat")

No pretrained weights, no API, no downloads. The architecture comes from model.py,
the tokenizer is built from YOUR text by data.py, and the training loop is
train.py's. This file is the control surface and it does not reimplement any of
the math.

WHO THIS IS FOR. Someone who has never heard of a transformer and should not have
to. Everything on the main screen is a button, a preset or a slider; there is
nothing to type and no setting whose name you must already understand. The
previous version asked for `layers`, `heads`, `embed dim`, `block_size`,
`dropout`, `learn rate`, `eval every`, `seed` and `top-k` as free text, which is
nine things you cannot fill in without already knowing the answer.

The old controls are all still here, under "Show advanced settings". Nothing was
removed - it was moved behind a door, and the door is shut by default.

THE GRAPH SHOWS SOMETHING A PERSON CAN READ. It used to plot raw cross-entropy
loss, where 2.774 means nothing to anyone who has not taken the course. It now
plots exp(loss), which is the number of characters the model is effectively still
choosing between for each next character - a quantity with units you can say out
loud. It starts at the size of your alphabet (pure guessing) and falls as the
model learns. Same numbers, same math, translated once.

Dependencies: torch + tkinter (stdlib). Nothing else.
