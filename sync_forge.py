"""sync_forge.py — publish the FORGE to its own public repository.

WHY A SECOND PUBLISHER. The forge already shipped, but as `dpo/` inside the
product repo: a subdirectory of a different project, with no front door of its
own. That is backwards from what the forge is for. Research-shaped work needs an
exact repository to cite, and the two projects have different audiences and make
different claims.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DUPLICATE. The whitelist and the forbidden-term pattern are
IMPORTED from sync_public, never copied. Two lists of "what may leave this
machine" would agree only with each other, and the day they diverge is the day
one of them is wrong without telling anyone.

THE RULES ARE THE SAME ONES, deliberately:
  1. WHITELIST ONLY. There is no "sync everything" mode and no glob over the
     repo root. A file not named here does not get published, ever.
  2. SCAN, THEN ABORT. Any forbidden term aborts the publish. It does NOT strip
     the line and continue -- a sanitiser would let a real leak through by
     quietly editing it into something that looks fine.
  3. The working repo's own record (the channel, the run logs, the handoff
     package) is not in the whitelist and never will be.
