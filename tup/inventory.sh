#!/bin/bash
# inventory.sh — hash every file tup contains, so two builds can be compared
# and so "we know exactly what is on this system" is a checkable claim.
#
#   bash tup/inventory.sh                 # run against the built $LFS tree
#   bash tup/inventory.sh /path/to/root   # or any root
#
# Output: tup/receipts/INVENTORY-<date>.txt — one line per regular file,
# `<sha256>  <mode> <size> <path>`, sorted by path, with symlinks recorded as
# `-> target` (their content is the target, and a link that changes target is
# a change worth seeing).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, in two parts:
#
# 1. THE REPRODUCIBILITY EXPERIMENT. Build tup twice from the same manifest
#    and diff two inventories. Files that differ are non-determinism —
#    embedded timestamps, build paths, ordering, parallelism. That is a
#    measurement with a yes/no answer and a countable result, and whatever
#    differs is a finding rather than a nuisance. Expect differences: this is
#    a plain LFS build, not a reproducible-builds-hardened one, so the honest
#    prediction is "many files differ" and the interesting number is WHICH.
#
# 2. THE COMPLETE INVENTORY. tup has no package manager, so the filesystem IS
#    the manifest. A system whose every file is enumerated and hashed is the
#    right subject for asking "is anything here that should not be" — which
#    is the security-smell question, asked of a system small enough to answer.
#
# Excluded (by directory, listed rather than silently dropped): the virtual
# filesystems (/proc /sys /dev /run), which are kernel state and not files;
# the build scaffolding (/sources /tup-build), which is not part of tup; and
# /tmp. Every exclusion is printed in the header, so the reader knows what
# was NOT looked at.
