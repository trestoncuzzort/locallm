"""bundle_receipts.py — turn the build's scattered evidence into one record.

    python3 tup/bundle_receipts.py            # pull from the build VM
    python3 tup/bundle_receipts.py --local /path/to/log

Collects, from the machine that did the work:
  * receipts.jsonl   — one line per page: package, seconds, exit, log sha256
  * SHA256-MANIFEST  — every source tarball as downloaded
  * driver.state     — the pages that actually completed
  * the test-policy record — which suites ran and which were skipped, BY NAME

and writes tup/receipts/BUILD-<date>.md: a single file a reader can check the
build against without trusting this script. Every number here is derived from
those files, and the files' own hashes are printed so the derivation can be
re-run.

WHAT THIS IS NOT: a proof the system is correct. It is a record of what was
built, from which bytes, in what order, with what outcome — provenance, not
verification. tup 0.1 is a WITNESSED system, not a verified one, and the
distinction is the whole point of keeping it.
