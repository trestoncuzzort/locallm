# prove 7: the Rocq STANDARD LIBRARY — a separate package since Rocq 9.
# Found the honest way: rocq-core built and installed clean, and then
# `Require Import ZArith` failed inside tup and the max task came back
# MALFORMED. The kernel without its stdlib can check proofs but cannot talk
# about arithmetic the way t's lowering speaks it (ZArith, lia).
# TUP_TARBALL=rocq-stdlib-9.2.0.tar.gz
# The rocq binary locates its own OCaml packages (rocq-runtime, the lia
# plugin) through findlib AT RUNTIME, and dune installed their METAs under
# /usr/lib/<pkg>/ — a directory findlib does not search. The stdlib build
# died on Fl_package_base.No_such_package("rocq-runtime") to prove it.
# Fix findlib's own config, not this page's env: every later consumer of
# the kernel (page 08's coqc included) needs the same resolution.
