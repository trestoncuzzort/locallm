# OVERRIDE ch08/87-cleanup: `rm -rf /tmp/{*,.*}` cannot succeed.
#
# The glob expands to include `.` and `..`, and rm REFUSES those and exits 1 —
# always, even when it removed everything else correctly. Under `set -e` the
# final page of chapter 8 therefore fails on its own success, which is the
# same shape as glibc's "no timeouts found" grep and binutils' zero-failure
# exit. A human running the book by hand sees the two refusal lines, shrugs,
# and moves on.
#
# find with -mindepth 1 does exactly what the book means and returns 0.
