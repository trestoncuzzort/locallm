# OVERRIDE ch08/81-util-linux: the bare `bash tests/run.sh` is the book's
# POST-REBOOT note, not a build step.
#
# The page runs `bash tests/run.sh --srcdir=$PWD --builddir=$PWD` outside the
# tup_tests_enabled guard, because the guard matches `make ... check|test` and
# this invokes the runner directly. Measured 2026-08-31: it fails immediately
# with "Tests not compiled! Run 'make check-programs' to fix the problem",
# because the suite was never built — the book's own text presents this as
# something to run later, from a booted system, as a normal user.
#
# So it becomes a no-op with the reason recorded, and util-linux's real test
# block (further down, correctly guarded) still obeys the test policy. The
# alternative — running `make check-programs` to satisfy it — would build and
# run a suite the ruling did not ask for, as root, in a chroot.
