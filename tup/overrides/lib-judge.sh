# lib-judge.sh — shared judgment for DejaGnu-style suites. Sourced by
# overrides; not a page override itself.
#
# The problem these solve: `make check` and `make -k check` exit nonzero for
# reasons that are not test failures (an unresolved testcase, a subdirectory
# that cannot build its harness), so the exit code is not the verdict. Each
# suite is judged by the criterion its own book page states — and where the
# book states NO mechanical criterion, that fact is recorded rather than a
# threshold being invented.

# Zero-FAIL judgment, for suites whose book page gives that recipe verbatim
# ("For a list of failed tests, run: grep '^FAIL:' $(find -name '*.log')").
