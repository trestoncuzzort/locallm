"""A replicate row must name the WHOLE verifier, not just the interpreter.

THE CLASS. Section 71 pinned the interpreter and taught every artifact to record
it, and `ruler_noise measure` refuses to pool replicates whose
`verifier["version"]` differs. That closes ONE of the two ways ground truth can
move under a series. The other is still open: forge.py, screen_tasks.py and the
screened task payloads define what verify() ACCEPTS, and a replicate row said
nothing about them. Loosen a BANNED pattern, shorten CAND_TIMEOUT, re-screen a
task -- every row still records the same interpreter, `measure` still counts the
old replicates as poolable, and 40 replicates that were scored under two
different verifiers become indistinguishable in the file. dataset_gate wrote that
failure mode down for the receipt ("every data hash still matches while the
*meaning* of 'verified' silently changes -- producing a PASSING receipt for a
weaker claim"); the replicate bank had no equivalent.

dataset_gate.verifier_fingerprint() ALREADY computes exactly the right thing --
sha256 of forge.py, of screen_tasks.py, of data/screen_results.jsonl, plus the
interpreter. The defect was that nothing put it on the row. So this file asserts
the row carries it, not that a new hashing scheme is correct.

RED WITNESS (pre-fix bytes, ruler_noise.replicate_row extracted but not yet
merging the fingerprint):
    FAIL test_row_carries_the_full_verifier_fingerprint: replicate row's
    verifier section is missing 4 key(s) that dataset_gate.verifier_fingerprint()
    defines: ['data/screen_results.jsonl', 'forge.py', 'interpreter',
    'screen_tasks.py'].

WHAT THIS DOES NOT ASSERT. It does not claim the fingerprint is complete as a
description of "what verified means" -- that scope decision lives in
dataset_gate's VERIFIER_FILES / TASK_SOURCE_FILES and this file deliberately
reads it from there rather than re-listing it, so widening the fingerprint
widens the test for free. It does not check that anything READS the new fields
to refuse pooling; recording is a precondition for that, not a substitute. And
it says nothing about rows already banked: those stay unfingerprinted, and are
evidence of that fact rather than something this fix can retroactively repair.

THE PIN, and why setting SRLM_VERIFY_PY here is not a mock. forge.py resolves
VERIFY_PY at import, and dataset_gate.verify_py() REFUSES (SystemExit) when
.venv-train is absent and no pin is declared -- deliberately, so an unpinned
machine cannot quietly score against the launcher. On a machine without the
venv, importing ruler_noise at all is therefore impossible until a pin is
declared. This module declares one, through the module's own documented
override, only when there is no venv and the operator has not already chosen:
that is the supported "deliberate pin" path, and it is recorded in the
fingerprint like any other. It is NOT a stub for verify_py/verifier_fingerprint
-- the hashes below are computed by the real gate against the real files on
disk. Consequence, stated rather than hidden: on such a machine the
`interpreter` half of the fingerprint is the launcher, so no assertion here
depends on the interpreter's IDENTITY, only on its PRESENCE.
