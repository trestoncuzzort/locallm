"""test_detectors.py — tests for the leakage detector.

    python test_detectors.py

No framework, no dependencies, no config. Run it and read the output.

Why this file exists, stated plainly because it is the point: the detector in
leakage.py shipped twice with a correctness bug that no test would have caught,
because there were no tests. Both bugs were found by a reviewer reading the
code, which is luck, not a system. This is the system.

Two rules the bugs themselves taught, and both are load-bearing here:

  ASSERT ON THE DECISION, NOT A SUB-METRIC. The first bug lived in one metric
  while a neighbouring metric still looked fine, and the report printed both. A
  human read the healthy number. So these tests assert on the VERDICT the tool
  actually returns, which is what a user acts on.

  DO NOT PICK TEST INPUTS BY HAND. The first bug was a fixed stride of 10, and
  every "obvious" test offset a person reaches for (0, 100, 500, 1000) is a
  multiple of 10, so a hand-written suite passes on the broken code. When an
  implementation parameter could align with a test input, the input must be
  adversarial or random. Every offset test below mixes round numbers with
  random.Random-drawn ones, and the random ones are what actually bite.

The old, broken fixed-stride sampler is KEPT here on purpose as a regression
oracle, and every test runs against both implementations so you can see which
tests actually discriminate.

BE PRECISE ABOUT WHAT THIS SUITE GUARANTEES, because the first version of this
docstring overstated it and a later one went stale on its own arithmetic. Read
off the two columns this file prints, not counted from memory:

    phase invariance                        old sampler 4/16 offsets   FAILS
    documented length guarantee             old sampler 16/20 runs     FAILS
    line arm has a denominator              old sampler 2 lines        FAILS
                                              -> SUSPECT via CONTENT overlap
    no false positive at scale                                         passes
    clean split reads CLEAN                                            passes
    short copies are caught                                            passes
    the floor does not swallow a full copy                             passes

Four of the seven pass against the known-broken sampler. That is not a defect in
them and it does not make them toothless: their regression target is the old
VERDICT RULE rather than the old fingerprinter, and each names the commit it
fails against.

  short copies are caught                 fails against leakage.py at 4b0b4f7,
                                          whose verdict read content overlap
                                          alone.
  the floor does not swallow a full copy   fails against leakage.py at 5d0c184,
                                          whose line floor gated the whole arm
                                          instead of its borderline band.

Both fixtures are the ones those changes were measured on, and they live in this
file rather than in a commit message because a fixture quoted in prose is not
run by anything.

NOT COVERED, measured rather than assumed: renamed or rewritten copies. The
detector scores 0% recall on identifier-renamed Python. No test here checks for
that, because the detector is not built to find it and a test would only assert
a known failure.
