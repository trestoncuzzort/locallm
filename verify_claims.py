"""verify_claims.py — check the README's factual claims against this repo.

    python verify_claims.py

A README is a set of promises. This file is the mechanism that keeps them true:
every empirical claim in README.md that CAN be checked mechanically is checked
here, against the artifacts that ship beside it, and the script exits non-zero if
any of them has drifted. No claim in the README is asked to be taken on trust
when a machine could settle it.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO, stated first because the limits are the honest part:

  - It cannot check claims about the FUTURE (the roadmap) or about taste
    ("small, readable"). Those are not falsifiable and are not touched here.
  - It cannot check hardware timings. The benchmark table is machine-specific;
    the README already tells you to run `bench_device.py` on your own machine,
    and this script only checks that the numbers quoted match the result file
    they were taken from, IF that file is present.
  - It cannot click the GUI. Tk needs a desktop session. `test_checkpoint.py`
    covers the logic the buttons call; nothing here proves a button is wired to
    it.
  - A passing run means "the claims this script knows how to check still hold".
    It is a fixed list, not a general fact-checker: a NEW unsupported sentence
    added to the README is not caught automatically. Flashlight, not fence.

Run it after editing README.md, and after any change to the experiment or
benchmark artifacts.
